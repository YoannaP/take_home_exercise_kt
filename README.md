# Prefix & Infix Calculator


### Sample input (caret prompt for clarity only):
```

3
> + 1 2
3
> + 1 * 2 3
7
> + * 1 2 3
5
> - / 10 + 1 1 * 1 2
3
> - 0 3
-3
> / 3 2
1 (or 1.5)
```


### Sample input (caret prompt for clarity only):
```
> ( 1 + 2 )
3
> ( 1 + ( 2 * 3 ) )
7
> ( ( 1 * 2 ) + 3 )
5
> ( ( ( 1 + 1 ) / 10 ) - ( 1 * 2 ) )
-1 (or -1.8)
```

## Additional Bonus
Create a web-based version of your calculator, as in a service with a RESTful interface. The goal would be to be able to interact with your calculator over the internet vs a standalone desktop based application.

# Deliverables:
A GitHub repo with your working code for the prefix and infix versions along with accompanying test cases
